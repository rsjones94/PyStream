# pyfluv

A python package for the analysis of stream planform, profile and cross sections with a focus on restoration and mitigation.

This project is currently in its alpha stage. Functionality is limited and there are no promises of correctness or stability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Pyfluv has only been tested for **Python 3.7**. There are no plans to test pyfluv with any other versions of Python,
but it *should* work with any **3.X** distribution.

### Installing

#### With pip

If you have pip on your machine, just

```
pip install pyfluv
```

from the terminal. Pip will install pyfluv's dependencies (as of version 0.22 these are numpy, matplotlib, sklearn and scipy) for you.

Once pyfluv is installed, it can be imported in Python with

```python
import pyfluv
```

## pyfluv basics

Because pyfluv is pre-alpha, it has limited functionality. Documentation will be updated when the alpha version is released.
