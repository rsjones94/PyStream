A Python package for the analysis of restoration geomorphology.

This project is currently in its alpha stage. Functionality is limited and there are no promises of correctness or stability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Pyfluv has only been tested for **Python 3.7**. There are no plans to test pyfluv with any other versions of Python,
but it should work with any **3.X** distribution.

### Installing

#### With pip

If you have pip on your machine, just

```
pip install pyfluv
```

from the terminal. Pip will install pyfluv's dependencies (as of version 0.3.2 these are numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn and scipy) for you.

Once pyfluv is installed, it can be imported in Python with

```python
import pyfluv
```

## pyfluv basics

Because pyfluv is currently in its alpha release, its functionality is subject to change. For an overview of its current functionality, please refer to the Jupyter notebooks hosted [here](https://github.com/rsjones94/pyfluv-notebooks).
