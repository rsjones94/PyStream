# pyfluv

A package for the analysis of stream planform, profile and cross sections with a focus on restoration and mitigation. Under development!

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of pyfluv on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Pyfluv is pip installable. If you choose not to pip install pyfluv, you'll need to make sure you have **numpy** on your machine, and you'll probably pip install that.
So why not just pip install pyfluv?

Pyfluv has only been tested for **Python 3.7**. There are no plans to test pyfluv with any other versions of Python, but it *should* work with any 3.x distribution.

### Installing

If you have pip on your machine, just
'''
pip install pyfluv
'''
from the terminal. Pip will install pyfluv's dependencies (as of version 0.10, just numpy) for you.

If you don't have pip installed or refuse to pip install pyfluv, then you can download the pyfluv folder and reference it from wherever you downloaded it to.
You will need to install numpy yourself.

Once pyfluv is installed, it can be imported in Python with
'''
import pyfluv
'''
## Built With

* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) - For manipulating arrays and linear algebra operations
